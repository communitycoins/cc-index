## Communitycoins.org
The Communitycoin Alliance kicked-off in may 2018 by a meeting in Lissabon between de developers of Cryptoescudo (CESC) and eGulden (EFL) and by a joint elaboration of the website communitycoins.org with a shared manifest. During the next four years the inititiative was mainly carried by the teams of eGulden, Auroracoin and Canadaecoin through weekly meetings while raiding each other communities and other teams. In 2023 Deutsche emark joined that group but the meeting frequency was reduced to allow for internal developments.
